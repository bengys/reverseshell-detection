Run detectshell.sh as root.
Make changes in mail.py for adress of sender and reciever of emails.

Detects and monitors the behaviour of a shell spawned by a remote attacker. For example, if an attacker manages to get a bind shell going on the target machine, this programme detects this and logs all the key strokes of the attacker. User will receive email updates and can send an email instruction to kill the process or get keystrokes emailed â€¦
